# Stocks Analysis

## Purpose

    The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve show his parents different stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 and whether or not they were worth investing in. To do this, we showed the total volume for one particular stock for either 2017 or 2018, and we also showed the return to that stock's investment using its beginning and ending prices. This return value was either positive or negative, giving a general idea on the stock's overall performance that year. After successfully completing the analysis with nested for loops, it was our job to refactor the code to find a quicker and more efficient way to achieve the same outcome.
