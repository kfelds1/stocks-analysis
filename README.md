# Stocks Analysis

## Background

Steve is looking to analyze the stock market but needs help finding a way to do it. Excel's Visual Basic Application is the perfect tool to analyze the performance of the 12 green stocks to show that DQ is not the only stock worth investing in.

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to help Steve show his parents different green stocks for the years 2017 and 2018 and whether or not they were worth investing in. To do this, I showed the total volume for one particular stock for either 2017 or 2018, and I also showed the return to that stock's investment using its beginning and ending prices. This return value was either positive or negative, giving a general idea on the stock's overall performance that year. After successfully completing the analysis with nested for loops, it was my job to refactor the code to find a quicker and more efficient way to achieve the same outcome.
